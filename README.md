## AI Usage Summary
AI tools were used throughout the development of this personal portfolio website to improve coding efficiency, problem-solving, and documentation.

**Tools Used:**  
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)

**Use Cases:**  
- **Understanding Requirements:** Helped break down assignment instructions into actionable tasks.  
- **Animation Integration:** Guided proper implementation of fade-in animations for both static and dynamically generated elements.  
- **Debugging GitHub API Display:** Assisted in resolving delays and asynchronous issues when fetching and displaying project cards.  
- **Code Optimization:** Suggested merging duplicate API requests to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary network calls.  
- **Performance & Image Optimization:** Recommended tools and strategies for Lighthouse testing and compressing images for faster loading.  
- **Documentation & Checklist Verification:** Reviewed README.md and overall project to ensure all requirements were met.

**Benefits:**  
- Saved time in understanding complex instructions.  
- Improved functionality, performance, and user experience.  
- Strengthened skills in JavaScript, API integration, animations, and code optimization.

**Challenges Overcome:**  
- Applying animations to dynamic content.  
- Handling asynchronous API requests correctly.  
- Managing state (theme toggle, personalized greeting, project filtering) efficiently.

**Learning Outcomes:**  
- Enhanced ability to read, understand, and implement assignment requirements.  
- Developed debugging and optimization skills for dynamic web applications.  
- Gained experience in responsibly documenting AI usage and integrating AI recommendations into real-world projects.
