# AI Usage Report – Assignment 3

## Tools Used
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)  

---

## Use Cases

1. **Understanding Assignment Requirements**  
   ChatGPT helped me understand the assignment instructions clearly and break down each requirement into actionable tasks.

2. **Animation Integration Guidance**  
   ChatGPT explained how to properly connect animations (fade-in) to each section in `index.html` and elements dynamically using JavaScript.

3. **Debugging GitHub Projects Display**  
   I faced an issue where project cards fetched from the GitHub API appeared with a delay due to CSS fade-in timing.  
   ChatGPT helped identify that the problem was in `script.js` and suggested how to fix it by properly applying the IntersectionObserver to dynamically created elements.

4. **Step-by-Step Checklist Verification**  
   ChatGPT guided me to check every requirement in the assignment systematically, ensuring all objectives were met.

5. **Ensuring Full Assignment Coverage**  
   ChatGPT reviewed my code structure, functionality, and documentation to confirm that all assignment requirements were implemented.

6. **README File Review**  
   ChatGPT provided suggestions for improving my README.md file to make it comprehensive and professional.

7. **Performance Testing Suggestions**  
   ChatGPT recommended ways to test performance using Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, and image compression strategies.

8. **Image Optimization Guidance**  
   ChatGPT suggested an online tool to compress images for better performance.

9. **Code Optimization**  
   ChatGPT helped me merge two duplicate GitHub API fetch requests into a single request to improve script efficiency and reduce unnecessary network calls.
